# VIRTUAL HERBAL GARDEN

This project leverages MedTech/HealthTech to bring the ancient knowledge of herbal medicine to life in a dynamic digital format. The Virtual Herbal Garden allows users to explore a rich collection of medicinal plants from AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy), providing insights into their healing properties and cultural relevance.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment

If you encounter issues where npm run build fails to minify, consider the following steps:

- Ensure that your dependencies are up to date.
- Check your project for outdated or incompatible packages.
